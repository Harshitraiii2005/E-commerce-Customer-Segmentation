E-commerce Customer Segmentation
This project aims to segment e-commerce customers into meaningful groups based on their behavior using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

What I Did
Data Processing & Dimensionality Reduction:
Applied PCA to reduce the original features down to two principal components for easier visualization and efficient modeling.

Clustering Models:
Implemented and compared three clustering algorithms:

KMeans

DBSCAN

Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)

Model Evaluation:
Used multiple clustering evaluation metrics like silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin score to assess cluster quality and select the best-performing model.

Parameter Tuning & Experiment Tracking:
Leveraged MLPipeline integrated with DVC (Data Version Control) to automate the workflow and track experiments effectively.

Modified params.yaml to tune hyperparameters such as number of clusters, PCA components, and DBSCANâ€™s eps and min_samples.

Used dvc-live to monitor live metrics during training and evaluation, enabling better decision-making in model selection.

Version Control & Reproducibility:
Managed data, models, and code versions with DVC, ensuring reproducibility and easy collaboration.
This setup also helps in comparing different models and hyperparameter configurations efficiently.

Model Saving:
Saved the final models for later inference and integration with downstream applications.
